# INFM 603: Information Technology and Organizational Context (Fall 2022)
### Catalog Description
Application of communication and information technologies to support work processes, including technology-enhanced communication networks, computer-supported collaborative work, decision-support systems, interactive systems, and systems analysis. Acquisition of information systems and their integration into the organization.

### Goals
Demonstrate mastery of foundational technologies for information management
Understand technical and content management issues that arise when deploying information technology in organizational settings
Gain experience with designing information technology capabilities to meet organizational needs
Learn and apply some widely-used information technology tools

### Approach
The class will meet in person every Wednesday from 6:00 to 8:45 PM in IRB Links to an external site. 2107 Links to an external site.. Each session will begin with a 60 minute presentation by the instructor (perhaps occasionally joined by a guest speaker), followed by a 60 minute mixture of small group activities and class discussion, and then by a final 30 minute presentation that will typically focus on an application setting.  There will be a 10 minute break between the first sessions and a 5 minute break after the second session. 

To guide our thinking about how technologies are used together, class sessions are grouped into four modules, each of which is motivated by some of the needs of a specific organization.  Over the course of the semester we will focus on different types of organizations and different types of needs, with the goal of illustrating how the technology choices we make reflect specific needs of specific organizations.

Our classroom has 9 tables for student groups, and in the first 5 weeks of the semester you will be assigned to sit with a different group of students each time.  In this way, you'll get to meet many of your classmates.  In week 6 we will assign project teams, and from then until the end of the semester you will normally sit with your project team.

You may bring food and drink with you to class, and you can eat in class or during breaks.  Please do wear a mask when not actively eating or drinking, though -- we're a large group in a fairly small room, and we can all help each other to stay healthy by using masks when we're together.

In the first part of the semester, our focus will be on core technologies.  There will be one homework assignment each week, always due on Tuesday (at 11:59 PM).  The goal of these assignments is to give you experience with a specific tool in a way that is designed to help you master key concepts in the course.

Future courses in the MIM program require the ability to create computer programs using python.  The first assignment is an ungraded diagnostic test to help you (and us) assess whether your programming skills would benefit from an intensive refresher.  If we (or you) conclude that such a refresher is needed, then we'll enroll you in a 5-week python "boot camp" group that combines additional video lectures on programming concepts with programming-focused homework assignments and a weekly mentoring session with the Teaching Assistant (TA).  Boot camp students will continue to attend class each week, but their python boot camp activities will replace other reading and homework assignments during that period.

As the semester progresses, we will expand our focus to pay equal attention to how these technologies are used to support the activities of an organization. During this part of the semester, students will complete a term project in which they demonstrate mastery of the integrated use of specific technologies to meet the specific needs of a specific organization. By examining technologies first individually and then more holistically, students will have the opportunity to enrich their understanding of how specific technologies interact to help achieve the objectives of an organization.  Students will be assigned to specific roles on their team (e.g., project manager, designer and tester, programming mentor, and programmer).  Boot camp students will typically be assigned as programmers, thus gaining hands-on experience with creation of a more complex system.

Course requirements, including your participation in the weekly class sessions, should take no more than 12 hours in the average week.  This includes the time required for assigned readings, homework assignments, project activities, and (if you do it) the python boot camp.  You will learn best if you divide the time you devote to this course over several days each week, since your mind will continue to process ideas even after you stop working.  So I recommend that you be proactive in arranging your schedule to do some work on this course on at least four different days each week (including our class on Wednesday).  Placing the homework deadline on Tuesday is intended to help with this, but it is up to you to arrange your schedule so that you don't focus all of your work for this course on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.

### Instructional Staff
The instructional staff includes the Professor, one Teaching Assistant (TA), and one grader.  The TA serves a mentor for project teams and (earlier in the semester) for the python boot camp.  The grader will grade all homework assignments, so if you have a grading question please contact the grader first, and then after that you can (and should!) discuss any unresolved concerns with the professor (or, for boot camp students, with the TA).

|Role |Name	|Email|
|----|----|----|
|Professor	|Doug Oard	|oard@umd.edu|
|TA	|Xin Qian	|xinq@umd.edu|
|Grader	|Melody Dastanlee	|mdastanl@umd.edu|

The professor's office hours are 3:45-4:45 PM on Tuesdays in IRB 4142, except on September 6 when office hours will be conducted at that same time on Zoom (because of a travel commitment) and on November 23 (when there will be no office hours because of Thanksgiving break).  The first office hours of the semester will be on August 30, and the last will be on December 6.  No prior arrangement is needed to come by during office hours.

During the first part of the semester, the TA will also schedule one mentoring sessions for all students in the python boot camp -- the time for that session will be arranged to fit student schedules, and to do that it may be on a weekend.   

During the second half of the semester, the Professor and TA will each serve as a mentor four project teams.  During this part of the semester, the TA will host optional weekly office hours for team mentoring discussions.

The Professor and TA are also happy to talk before and after class, and at other mutually convenient times by phone or Zoom if coming to office hours is not possible for you.  Email is the best way to reach us to set up an appointment, and it is also a good way to get a quick answer to a simple question.

The grader will not have scheduled office hours, but you can contact them by email to set up a time to talk by zoom if you have grading questions.

### Schedule
The schedule that shows what we will cover each week can be found in the Modules section of the course ELMS site.

### Course Materials
This ELMS site contains the most recent version of all material produced for this course. 

Reading assignments for each sessions can be found in that session page in Modules. The principal texts for this course are:

### Announcements
Announcements will normally be posted to the announcements section of the course ELMS site.  Students should ensure that ELMS is configured to alert them when announcements are posted.  The course also has a Google Groups mailing list that may in rare cases be used for announcements if ELMS is having problems. Students will be automatically added to that mailing list using their terpmail address.  University of Maryland students should ensure that their terpmail account is forwarded to wherever they routinely read email.

### Grading
Student grades will be computed by adding:

up to 10 points for contributions made to class sessions (max of 1 point each session for at most 10 graded class sessions). There are 11 graded class sessions (this excludes the first two weeks of the semester, which are ungraded, and session 14, which is a part of the project grade).  Participation grades already account for the one self-certified absence that the university allows.  Requests for additional exceptions must be made in advance, and their approval will be based on university policy.  Examples of possible exceptions include religious observances affecting more than one class session, or an extended illness affecting more than one class session.
up to 5 points for each of the 5 graded homework assignments.  The programming skills assessment is ungraded. 
up to 35 points for the team project, including up to 10 points for the design report deliverable, up to 10 points for the prototype deliverable, up to 10 points for the test report deliverable, and up to 5 points for the in-class team presentation.  All team members who contribute meaningfully to a project deliverable or presentation will receive the same grade for that item.  Team members who do not contribute meaningfully to a project deliverable or presentation will receive a grade of zero for that item.
up to 30 points for the final exam.
up 5 bonus points may be awarded at the end of the semester for specific exceptional contributions to the course
Thus at most 105 points are possible.  Totals above 100 points will be rounded down to 100. Grades of A will be awarded for total scores of 90-100; B for 80-89.999; C for 70-79.999, D for 60-69.999, and F for total points below 60.  Plus and minus grades are assigned to the highest and lowest two points, respectively, in each grade band (e.g., 90 to 91.999 is an A-; 98 to 100 is an A+).

Everything is to be submitted using ELMS, and everything is due on a Tuesday at 11:59 PM.  Deadlines are sharp, and points awarded will be reduced by 1 point per hour for every hour that an item is late, starting at the time the item is due (i.e., even 1 minute late will result in a penalty).  ELMS will allow you to submit early, and to resubmit assignments as often  as you like; only the last version submitted before the deadline will be graded.

We are always happy to discuss grading decisions.  Except for the final exam, you should first contact the grader, who is the person who will have assigned the grade (for the final exam, the professor will assign the grade, and in that case you should contact the professor directly).  If you still have concerns you should discuss them with the professor.  If you continue to believe that an assignment has been incorrectly graded, you can and should file an appeal.  Appeals must be filed in writing within 7 days of receiving your grade on ELMS by sending an email to all three of the grader, the professor, and the TA.  Grade appeals must be in writing, they must identify one or more specific rubric items that you believe were incorrectly graded, and they must include a detailed justification based on the requirements stated in the assignment note: the basis for an appeal must be the full assignment, not just in the rubric!).  Appealed grades will be completely regraded by the professor, after talking with the grader to understand the basis for their decisions.  Grade appeals can result in increases or decreases in the total number of points, as the entire assignment will be regraded (with due consideration to the rubric items that were specifically identified in the appeal).  Grade appeals will be acknowledged within 24 hours, so if you don't receive a reply in that time frame please contact us in some other way.  Decisions on appealed grades will be made within two weeks of receipt (and usually faster) and you will be informed of the decision by email. 

With the exception of the team project deliverables and presentation (each of which should be the joint work of the entire project team), all material that is submitted for grading must be produced by the individual student who is submitting the material.  Plagiarism, whether intentional or inadvertent, is a serious offense for which the student honor council imposes severe sanctions.  All assignments must include the university Honor pledge: "I pledge on my honor that I have not given or received any unauthorized assistance on this assignment."  You must hand-type the pledge (no cut and paste) and then hand type your name after it as your signature.
