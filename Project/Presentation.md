# Project Presentation

Your project presentation should be a 15 minute video. You can either submit a video file or the URL for the video if you choose to make it available online (which is not required).

I recommend that you use powerpoint to illustrate the points in your presentation, but you can make your video in whatever way you want. The presentation should start with a brief description of your goals, stated in terms of the user experience. A brief demo of the result (i.e., whatever system you have built) should follow, and that should then be followed by a description of:

* how the work was divided among the project partners,
* the most interesting of the implementation details,
* a complete list of limitations, and
* some reflection on the lessons that you learned by doing the project.
* You may also include recommendations for improving the project experience in future semesters if you wish.

You can allocate time between these as you wish, but you may not run long -- your presentation must end precisely 15 minutes after it starts; presentations that exceed the length limit will be penalized at one point per minute beond the allowed 15 minutes, starting one second beyond 15 minutes!

If you did use powerpoint (or can easily convert what you did to powerpoint), please also upload your powerpoint slides.  If not, upload any presentation materials that you used as PDF.  Speaker's notes are optional -- if you used them you can include them, but you don't need to add speaker's notes if you didn't actually use them in your presentation. 

The grade for this assignment is for your presentation -- note that it is your team's presentation being graded, not the project (which was graded with the test report).
