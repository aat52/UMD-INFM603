# Prototype

You should plan your project so that you have a working version of your system by the time this assignment is due.  You will turn in to things.  One is the working system itself.  If your project is on the Web, all you need to send is a URL.  If your project needs to be run as a standalone system, then you need to send whatever we will need to actually run your project (for example, if your project is an Access database, then you would need to send the database file; if your project is a python program that runs in a Colab notebook, then you would need to clone the notebook and send us a link to that clone).

The other thing you need to submit is a description of the system.  This should reference your detailed design document, identify design changes since that document was submitted, then describe the implementation (including identifying what has and hasn't been implemented), and finally it should provide instructions for running (and, if needed, for installing) your system.

The grade will be in two parts.  7 points will be for the project itself; 3 points will be for the system description.

## Feedback
- scope is good
- great work on end to end implementation
- results seem to have much lower than 99% accuracy
- discuss test planning
- better way of selecting location would be a nice addition
- how does this work with paywalls? (Bloomberg, Washington Post, NYT, etc)
- how do I select my own hashtag of interest?
- pip installation should precede first cell block because of reboot requirements
