# Drupal Website

Use Drupal to create a simple Website for the iSchool at the University of Maryland.  Include three roles: the site administrator (who creates roles), two content editors (one from the undergrad program and one from the MIM program) that can only edit their own content, a layout designer who sets up the look and feel of the Web site, and the grader.  You will play the part of each of the people except the grader.  As layout designer, separate the information for current students, future students, university employees (i.e., faculty and staff), and the general public.  Then (acting as each of the content editors), create some content items for each of the two programs, and as Layout Designer link those into the site at the appropriate points.  Give the grader account full administrative privileges with the userid and password that we will send you by email.  Then submit the administrator URL for your site using ELMS for grading.  Do not make any changes to the site after submission until you receive your grade.
